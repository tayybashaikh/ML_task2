                              # Elevate Lab Internship – ML Task 2

## Task Overview
Data Cleaning and Missing Value Handling on **Medical Appointment No Shows Dataset**.  
Handled missing values, validated dataset, and prepared it for ML tasks.

## Tools & Libraries
- Python 3.x  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- VS Code / Jupyter Notebook  

## Dataset
- `Medical_Appointment_No_Shows.csv` (from Kaggle)  
- Features include patient info, appointment dates, and no-show labels  

## Steps Performed
1. Loaded and inspected the dataset  
2. Checked missing values and visualized them  
3. Imputed missing numerical values using median  
4. Imputed missing categorical values using mode  
5. Dropped columns with >50% missing values  
6. Validated dataset after cleaning  
7. Saved cleaned dataset as `Medical_Appointment_Cleaned.csv`  

## Files
- `task2.py` – Python script with cleaning steps  
- `Medical_Appointment_No_Shows.csv` – Original dataset  
- `Medical_Appointment_Cleaned.csv` – Cleaned dataset  
- `README.md` – This file  

## Notes
